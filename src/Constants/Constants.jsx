    {
        question: "How high can I build a fence?",
        answer: `The allowable height of a fence is largely influenced by its
        location in the yard and the local regulations. Front yard fences often have a maximum height of 4 feet,
        while side and rear yard fences may typically reach 6 or 7 feet in certain cities.
        Corner lots might have additional restrictions due to safety concerns related to vehicles and pedestrians,
        impacting fence opacity and height based on city regulations.`,
    },
    {
        question: "How much does a fence cost?",
        answer: `The cost of a fence can vary based on factors such as material,
    length, height, and any additional features, we encourage you to try our
    free instant quote tool or reach out for an estimate.
    `,
    },
    {
        question: "Why steel post?",
        answer: `We are believers in higher quality products.
    Galvanized steel will outlast a wood post everyday of the week.
    Driving capabilities are added benefits allowing us to have stronger, cleaner installation
    with out the use of heavy machinery or lugging around hazardous concrete.
    `,
    },
    {
        question: "What are differences between cedar vs. pressure treated?",
        answer: `Cedar offers several advantages over pressure-treated fences.
    It is naturally resistant to decay and insects, reducing the need for chemical treatments.
    Cedar is known for its distinct, attractive appearance and aromatic scent. It’s also lighter in weight,
    making it easier to handle during installation. Additionally, cedar has a lower environmental
    impact compared to pressure-treated wood, aligning with sustainable and eco-friendly practices.
    `,
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to be home for install?",
        answer: `While your presence during the installation is not mandatory,
    we highly encourage it. We value clear communication and prefer conducting walkthroughs
    before and after the project to ensure everyone is aligned with the expectations.
    `,
    },
    {
        question: "Survey?",
        answer: `While not mandatory in every city, having a survey is highly recommended to minimize
    future complications associated with the fence installation.
    `,
    },
    {
        question: "What are differences between pounding vs concrete?",
        answer: `Concrete has its applications in fencing, but we find superior advantages
    with driven posts. Our method involves driving thick steel posts deeper than typical concrete installations,
    reaching below the frost line in Minnesota to prevent heaving. Unlike concrete, which can crack over time, our
    driven posts can avoid messy, labor-intensive processes, often eliminating the need for heavy machinery and causing
    minimal soil disruptions—critical factors in ensuring a solid fencing solution.
