                        What others consider upgrades, we consider run of the mill. When it comes to materials,
                        we drive thicker gauge steel in the ground for all of our fence systems and all posts are driven 4-5‚Äô deep.
                        We do <strong>NOT</strong> subcontract our jobs. Any fence we install is done in house, and we pride ourselves on the quality control of
                        each of our installs. This allows us to streamline a smooth process from consultation to installation! üõ†Ô∏èüè°</p>

                <h1 className='text-3xl mb-10'><strong>Why we use galvanized steel posts:</strong></h1>
                <ol className='w-2/3 m-auto mb-10 text-left'>
                    <li className='text-xl pb-5 border-b-4'><strong>Corrosion Resistance</strong>: Galvanized steel is coated with a layer of zinc, providing excellent corrosion resistance.
                        This protects the post from rust and deterioration caused by exposure to the elements.</li>
                    <li className='text-xl pb-5 pt-5 border-b-4'><strong>Longevity</strong>: The galvanization process significantly extends the lifespan of steel posts, making them more durable and
                        able to withstand harsh weather conditions over an extended period.</li>
                    <li className='text-xl pb-5 pt-5 border-b-4'><strong>Low Maintenance</strong>: Galvanized steel posts require minimal maintenance compared to wood posts.
                        They don't rot, warp, or decay, reducing the need for regular upkeep and replacements.</li>
                    <li className='text-xl pb-5 pt-5 border-b-4'><strong>Strength and Stability</strong>: Galvanized steel is inherently strong, providing robust support for the fence. This strength is crucial in
                        maintaining the stability of the fence, especially in areas prone to high winds or heavy loads.</li>
                    <li className='text-xl pb-5 pt-5 border-b-4'><strong>Drivability</strong>: With our driven system we are eliminating one of the most common issues with fence post here in Minnesota and that‚Äôs
                        frost heaving. Driving post 4‚Äô+ beneath our frost line ensures their will not be any heaving, as heaving has near 0% occurrence rate when a post is driven
                        properly and to depth due to its minimal soil disruption.</li>
