## Description
Nate's Fence and Gate allows users to view several different fence types across the application and consider what option suits their needs. The app is built with React, Tailwind CSS, and mySalesman and is hosted at [https://www.natesfenceandgate.com](https://www.natesfenceandgate.com) using AWS and Heroku.
